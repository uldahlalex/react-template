# React component exercises

### Intro
These exercises try to appeal to a more DIY-ish style of learning, where you try to solve small tasks on your own. 
If you require more support / walkthrough style exercises, I recommend picking the React Quick-Start guide instead: https://react.dev/learn

I recommend watching my video about React components if you don't know anything yet. (See my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/@alexdevden/videos)

I have made this template to give you starting point with recommended dependencies, Typescript configuration and linting.
There are some files you don't need - I recommend simply ignoring these - you can just make the exercises inside the exercises.tsx file.

You can start the app with **npm install** and **npm run dev** and navigating to localhost port 4200.

I have made some example solutions inside solutions.tsx in case you're curious.

## Exercises in ascending order of difficulty

1) Present the value of a variable inside a component.
2) Conditionally render the value based on a boolean expression.
3) Put a component inside another component.
4) Present the values X number of types without duplicating the code.
5) Change the presented value on a button click.
6) Make an input element + a button that can add elements to a list on the screen
